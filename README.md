# Reusuable Component Practice

This was created to practice making 'reusuable component' in React.

The 'Component' will take in variant type to determine the final CSS style, along with various other props for accessibility and needs

# Component Design
* it takes various props such as 'image, variant = '', priorityTitle, duration, enableButton = true, secondaryTitle, createdBy, altDescription' from its parent.
* since the component is already set to its 'default', if variant is not specifically given, the component will display as its default form.


I have created a JSON file to map through in App.jsx
